pep 8 -- > python enhancment proposal
python no need compiler compiler to run 
     --> python code is fast to develope 
     --> python code is not as fast in excution
                       --> because an additional layer of python virtual machine is responsible for the excetion of code

Static typed language :
        Data Type are checked before execution 
Dynamic typed language :
        Data type are checked during execution
is indentation required ?
       it provide better readability
kewords :
    --> False ,True ,from ,or ,None ,elif ,and ,import ,pass ,with

Data Type in python :
     --> str ,int ,float ,complex ,list ,tuple ,range ,dic ,set ,bool ,None

list :
    --> it defined in  square bracket
    --> it is orded 
    --> it is mutable 
    --> we can add different datatype
     --> indicies is used to access the the file

Dictionary :
    --> Unorder collection of item
    --> each item have key/value
    --> we cannot access them using indicies

Iteration :
     --> Objects like list ,turple ,sets ,dictionary ,string etc.

Function :
     --> 
Object Oriented Programming :

     --> Class 
     --> Object
     --> Encapsulation
     --> Inheritance
     --> Polimorphism
     --> Abstraction

Class :
A class is a collection of instance variables and related methods that define a particular object type. You can think of a class as an object's blueprint or template. 
Attributes are the names given to the variables that make up a class. A class instance with a defined set of properties is called an object. As a result, the same class can be used to construct as many objects as needed.

Encapsulation :
            Encapsulation is the process of preventing clients from accessing certain properties, which can only be accessed through specific methods.

               --> Public  
                            self.c = 10
               --> protected
                            self._c = 10
               --> Private
                            self.__c = 10

Inheritance :
          It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. 
          Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. 

# Python code to demonstrate how parent constructors
# are called.

# parent class
class Person(object):

	# __init__ is known as the constructor
	def __init__(self, name, idnumber):
		self.name = name
		self.idnumber = idnumber

	def display(self):
		print(self.name)
		print(self.idnumber)

# child class
class Employee(Person):
	def __init__(self, name, idnumber, salary, post):
		self.salary = salary
		self.post = post

		# invoking the __init__ of the parent class
		Person.__init__(self, name, idnumber)

# creation of an object variable or an instance
a = Employee('Rahul', 886012, 200000, "Intern")

# calling a function of the class Person using its instance
a.display()

Polimorphism :
              The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. 
              The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.

Abstraction :
                Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to hide the implementation details of a program from the user. 
In Python, abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are used to define a blueprint for other classes to follow. 
Interfaces, on the other hand, are used to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
